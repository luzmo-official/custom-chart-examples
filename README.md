# Luzmo Custom Chart Examples

This repository contains **example implementations of custom charts** created by Luzmo employees, and goes hand-in-hand with [the `custom-chart-builder` repository](https://github.com/luzmo-official/custom-chart-builder) that's used while developing Custom charts.

The goal is to provide inspiration and reference material for Luzmo customers who want to build their own custom visualizations!
